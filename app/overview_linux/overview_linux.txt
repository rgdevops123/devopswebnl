Q: What is System load/CPU Load?


 A measurement of CPU over or under-utilization in a Linux system; the
number of processes which are being executed by the CPU or in waiting
state. Load average – is the average system load calculated over a
given period of time of 1, 5 and 15 minutes.


Q: What is Main PID?

Main PID is the PID of the process that is started using ExecStart=
options (in the example sshd). The Process: is used for any other
process that might have been started by the service using
ExecStartPre, ExecStartPost, ExecStopPost, etc options. (in this
example, sshd-keygen has been started using the ExecStartPre=option).
You can have multiple lines on Process: if there are more than one
processes started by the service, other than the main process. If
there is no other process involved, you will only see the Main PID
value.

I admit this is not very clear in the docs for ExecStartPre but the
doc for ExecStartclarifies that the main process is the one started by
that option, except for Type=forking, in which case, the daemon
process is considered the main process.


Q: Create a system account with a specified home directory.

# useradd -r app1 -d /apps/app1
     Creates an "app1" user and an "/apps/app1" home directory.

-r, --system
           Create a system account.

           System users will be created with no aging information in
/etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are chosen in the
           SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in /etc/login.defs,
instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the
           creation of groups).

           Note that useradd will not create a home directory for such
an user, regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs
           (CREATE_HOME). You have to specify the -m options if you
want a home directory for a system account to be created.

-d, --home-dir HOME_DIR
           The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value
for the user's login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN
           name to BASE_DIR and use that as the login directory name.


Q:  Create a shell script to add a path.

Q: What is Apache Tomcat?

Apache Tomcat (or simply Tomcat) is an open source web server and
servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages ( JSP )
specifications from Oracle Corporation, and provides a “pure Java”
HTTP web server environment for Java code to run.


Q: What is the difference between Apache and Tomcat?

Apache Tomcat is used to deploy your Java Servlets and JSPs. So in
your Java project you can build your WAR (short for Web ARchive) file,
and just drop it in the deploy directory in Tomcat. So basically
Apache is an HTTP Server, serving HTTP. Tomcat is a Servlet and JSP
Server serving Java technologies.


Q: What is the difference between Tomcat and JBoss?

The Major Differences Between JBoss and Tomcat. Both JBoss and Tomcat
are Java servlet application servers, but JBoss is a whole lot more.
... One way to think of it is that JBoss is a JEE stack that includes
a servlet container and web server, whereas Tomcat, for the most part,
is a servlet container and web server.

Q: How do you turn on quota on a filesystem . . . I.E.: /data3?

# quotaon /data3/


Q: How do you assign user & group disk quota?

# edquota -u jsmith
Disk quotas for user jsmith (uid 1002):
  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes
    soft     hard
  /dev/mapper/vg01-data3            0       3000       6000          0
       0        0


soft : It will warn the users if the soft limit of disk quota reached
( size is in KB), in above example for jack user soft limit is 3000 KB
( approx 3MB )

hard : It will not allow the users to create new files once the hard
limit is reached. ( Size in KB ), in above example hard limit for jack
user is 6000 KB ( approx 6 MB )

Note : We can also set the Quota on the basis of the inodes ( i.e
numbers of files that the user can create on particular file system)


Q: How do you display Quota report for Users in human readable form?

# repquota -as

-a, --all
   Report on all filesystems indicated in /etc/mtab to be read-write
with quotas.

-s, --human-readable
   Try to report used space, number of used inodes and limits in more
appropriate units than the default ones.

Q: What is a Dentry?

A data structure used to represent a Directory.


Q: What is an INODE?

    inode - a data structure used to represent a filesystem object,
which can be one of various things including a file or a directory.


Q: What information is contained in an Inode?

   owner type size
   group permissions dates
   pointers to data


Q: What are the dates in an inode?


Access: last time the contents of the file were examined.
Modify: Last time the contents of the file were changed.
Change: Last time the file's inode was changed.

The change time includes things like modifying the permissions and
ownership, while the modify time refers specifically to the files
contents.


Q: What command/system call can you use to get Inode information?

   stat: Getting inode information

   stat() is a Unix system call that returns useful data about a file inode.

   Example:
# stat /tmp/test123.txt
File: `/tmp/test123.txt'
Size: 23              Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fd02h/64770d    Inode: 17          Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (  500/ user1)   Gid: (  501/   ossec)
Access: 2011-01-21 12:56:05.000000000 -0500
Modify: 2011-01-21 06:36:01.000000000 -0500
Change: 2011-01-21 06:36:01.000000000 -0500


Q: How do you get the long listing of a file?

# ls -l | grep test123.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user1  ossec        23 Jan 21 06:36 test123.txt


Q: How do you get the inode number of a file?

# ls -i | grep test123.txt
17 test123.txt


Q: What are the process states in Unix?

Running : The process is either running or it is ready to run.

Waiting : The process is waiting for an event or for a resource.

Stopped : The process has been stopped, usually by receiving a signal.

Zombie : The process is dead but have not been removed from the process table.


Q: What are the process states in Unix via the ps aux|-elf BSD Format?

D uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R running or runnable (on run queue)
S interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced
W paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X dead (should never be seen)
Z defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent


Q: What is a Zombie process?

   Zombie = When a program forks and the child finishes before the
parent, the kernel still keeps some of its information about the child
in case the parent might need it - for example, the parent may need to
check the child's exit status. To be able to get this information, the
parent calls `wait()'; In the interval between the child terminating
and the parent calling `wait()', the child is said to be a `zombie'.

(If you do `ps', the child will have a `Z' in its status field to
indicate this.)

Finding Zombies => ps aux | grep -w Z


Q: How can you create and test for a Zombie process?

# vim zombie.c
+++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main ()
{
  pid_t child_pid;

  child_pid = fork ();
  if (child_pid > 0) {
    sleep (60);
  }
  else {
    exit (0);
  }
  return 0;
}
+++

# cc zombie.c -o zombie

# ./zombie

# ps aux | grep -w Z
root      9662  0.0  0.0      0     0 pts/0    Z+   21:29   0:00
[zombie] <defunct>


Q: What is a Orphan process?

   Orphan = An orphan process is a computer process whose parent
process has finished or terminated, though itself remains running.

In a Unix-like operating system any orphaned process will be
immediately adopted by the special init system process. This operation
is called re-parenting and occurs automatically. Even though
technically the process has the "init" process as its parent, it is
still called an orphan process since the process that originally
created it no longer exists.


Q: How do you find Orphan process?

# ps -elf | awk '{if ($5 == 1){print $4" "$5" "$15}}'

• * Socket - The socket system call creates a new socket by assigning
a new descriptor.

• * Bind - The bind system call associates a local network transport
address with a socket

• * Listen - This call indicates that the server process is ready to
accept any new incoming connections

• * Accept - The accept system call is a blocking call that waits for
incoming connections.

• * Connect - The connect system call is normally called by the client
process to connect to the server process.

• * Shutdown - The shutdown system call closes either one or both ends
of the connection.

• * Close - The close system call closes or aborts any pending
connections on the socket.

• * Send - There are four system calls to send data on the n/w
interface: write, writev, sendto, and sendmsg.

Q: What is the difference between a logical link and hard link?

inode & across filesystems.

- Hard Link: link to physical file
   More than one filename reference the same inode number.
   Hard links must reside on the same filesystem as the real/source file.
   The real/source file must exist.

- Soft Link: link to path
   Special file (with unique inode) is created that points to real/source file.
   Special file is called 'soft link' or a 'symbolic link' (aka a 'symlink').
   Soft links can reside on separate filesystems than the real/source file.
   The real/source file does not have to exist.
   Additional I/O necessary to complete file access.
   Additional storage taken up by Soft Link's file data.


Q: What is od?

octal dump


Q: What is tr?

translate or delete characters

Example: # tr -d '\177' <file


Q: What tools can you use to clean up files with bad/mystery characters in it?

dos2unix, cat -v, od -c

od -c : prints out all regular characters in ASCII.

null         \0
backspace    \b
form-feed    \f
new-line     \n
return       \r
tab          \t

- if od doesn't recognize a regular ASCII character, it will dump the
octal value.  See Example 4.


   Example 1: "cat -v"
   ----------
host # cat file
def
host # cat -v file
abc^Mdef


   Example 2: "od -c"
   ----------
host # od -c file
0000000 a b c \r d e f \n
0000010

       Note:
       -----
       - With the "-c" flag used, the "^M" character shows up as "\r".
       - The byte-offset is also off ... it should be 7 instead of 10
like the below example.

    Example 3: "cat", "cat -v" & "od -c" with no funny characters.
   ----------
host # cat file
abcdef

host # cat -v file
abcdef

host # od -c file
0000000 a b c d e f \n
0000007


    Example 4: od does not recognize and can not translate ASCII character.
   ----------
host # cat file
bcdef

host # cat -v file
a^?bcdef

host # od -c file
0000000 a 177 b c d e f \n
0000010


    Example 4: Solution.
   ----------
host # cat file
bcdef

host # cat -v file
a^?bcdef

host # od -c file
0000000 a 177 b c d e f \n
0000010

host # tr -d '\177' <file
abcdef

host # tr -d '\177' <file >file2 <--- Where the magic happens...
host # cat file2
abcdef

host # cat -v file2
abcdef

host # od -c file2
0000000 a b c d e f \n
0000007

Q: How can you send standard output and standard error of cmd to
standard output (terminal) and to files?

# cmd 2>&1 | tee files


Q: What is tee?

Send output to Screen & File.

Example:
# ls -1 *.txt | wc -l | tee count.txt

Explanation:
In the above example, the ls command lists all files in the current
directory that have the filename extension .txt, one file per line;
this output is piped to wc, which counts the lines and outputs the
number; this output is piped to tee, which writes the output to the
terminal, and writes the same information to the file count.txt. If
count.txt already exists, it is overwritten.

Q: Why should you have regular/weekly server reboots?

   - Potential Memory Leaks.
   - Security.


Q: What is a Memory Leak?

   It is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program
incorrectly manages memory allocations. In such a way that memory
which is no longer needed is not released. In object-oriented
programming, a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in
memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.  A memory leak has
symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only
be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.


Q: What is the benefit of using the Python logging module?

The ability to create new handlers with higher- or lower-severity
filters can be very helpful when writing and testing an application.
Instead of using many print statements for debugging, use
logger.debug: Unlike the print statements, which you will have to
delete or comment out later, the logger.debug statements can remain
intact in the source code and remain dormant until you need them
again. At that time, the only change that needs to happen is to modify
the severity level of the logger and/or handler to debug.


Q: What are the advanced Python logging components?

watchfor /success|accepted|rgriffith/
         echo
         write robrg

+++

# /usr/bin/swatch --daemon --config-file=/etc/swatch.conf
--tail-file=/var/log/messages --pid-file=/var/run/swatch.pid

### NOTE: The above will watch /var/log/messages for messages
containing “success or accepted or rgriffith”.  If found, it will
email robrg the message.

Q: How can you tell what kind of system you are on … System V, Upstart, Systemd?

/usr/lib/systemd tells you you're on a systemd based system.

/usr/share/upstart is a pretty good indicator that you're on an
Upstart-based system.

/etc/init.d tells you the box has SysV init in its history

$ /sbin/init --version init (upstart 0.6.5)

running: where the job is fully operational

pre-stop: where pre-stop operations take place

stopping: where the job is being stopped

killed: where the job is stopped

post-stop: where post-stop operations take place - to clean up


Q: Where are the Upstart logs located?

   /var/log/upstart/

do a="$(echo $i | sed s/us/un/)";
mv "$i" "$a";
done


Q: How do you insert text at the front of filenames?

   for i in `ls`; do a=calmem1-"$i"; mv "$i" "$a"; done


Q: How do you remove whitespace from filenames?

   # for i in *; do a="${i// /_}";  mv "$i" "$a"; done

NOTE:
*\ * selects all files with a space in their name as input for the the for loop.

The quotes around "$f" are important because we know there's a space
in the filename and otherwise it would appear as 2+ arguments to mv.

In ${i// /_}:
  The double slashes // are for replacing all occurrences of space
with _, if you put one slash  /, only first space is going to be
replaced.
  The space is there because you are replacing space (with underscore)
      ${parameter//find/replace}



Q: How do you replace _-_ in filenames?

   # for i in *; do a="${i//_-_/_}";  mv "$i" "$a"; done
